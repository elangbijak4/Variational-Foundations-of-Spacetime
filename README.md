# Variational Foundations of Spacetime

This repository contains two closely related research papers developing a unified variational perspective on the origin of time, space, dimensionality, and topology.

The central idea underlying both papers is that the **principle of action** should be understood not merely as a methodological tool within physics, but as a **pre-physical organizing rule** that governs which spacetime structures are physically realizable.

## Overview

Modern physics derives dynamical laws and geometric structures through variational principles, yet typically assumes the existence of spacetime, its dimensionality, and its temporal orientation. This project inverts that hierarchy.

We propose that:
- temporal direction,
- spatial geometry,
- dimensionality,
- and global topology

are **not primitive inputs**, but **outputs of a global variational selection mechanism**.

The project is divided into two complementary papers.

## Paper I — Conceptual Foundations

**Title:**  
*The Principle of Action as a Pre-Physical Organizing Rule: Time, Space, and Dimensional Selection*

**Focus:**  
Conceptual, ontological, and philosophical foundations.

**Summary:**  
Paper I develops the conceptual argument that the principle of action operates prior to spacetime itself. The arrow of time is not derived from entropy or probabilistic assumptions, but from global variational consistency. Spatial geometry and dimensionality are likewise treated as emergent outcomes rather than assumptions.

Statistical mechanics and thermodynamics are interpreted as **emergent, intra-history descriptions**, valid only after spacetime has been realized.

This paper contains no formal axioms or theorems and is intended to establish logical coherence and conceptual motivation.

## Paper II — Axiomatic and Formal Development

**Title:**  
*An Axiomatic Variational Framework for the Emergence of Time, Space, and Topology*

**Focus:**  
Formal, axiomatic, and deductive development.

**Summary:**  
Paper II presents a minimal axiomatic framework in which physically realizable universes correspond to **stable extremal histories of a global action functional**. No temporal orientation, spatial geometry, dimensionality, or topology is assumed a priori.

Key results include:
- derivation of temporal orientation from stability of extremal histories,
- emergence of spatial geometry via Euler–Lagrange structure,
- dimensional selection through global stability constraints,
- topological selection by exclusion of unstable global modes.

Established physical theories are interpreted as **effective descriptions operating within a realized history**, rather than as fundamental selectors of spacetime structure.

Two appendices clarify genericity, stability assumptions, and provide illustrative classes of admissible actions.
